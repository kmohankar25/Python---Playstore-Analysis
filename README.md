➤ Objective :-

The objective of this project is to gain insights into the applications hosted on Google Playstore and the sentiment of their user reviews and present these insights in the form of visualisation which can be used to improve the overall experience and optimise the application development processes.

➤ Data Source : Kaggle
playstore_apps.csv - It contains the basic details of the app like number of user reviews, ratings, etc.

App: It contains the name of the app with a short description (optional).
Category: This section gives the category to which an app belongs. In this dataset, the apps are divided among 33 categories.
Size: The disk space required to install the respective app.
Rating: The average rating given by the users for the respective app. It can be in between 1 and 5.
Reviews: The number of users that have dropped a review for the respective app.
Installs: The approximate number of times the respective app was installed.
Type: It states whether an app is free to use or paid.
Price: It gives the price payable to install the app. For free type apps, the price is zero.
Content rating: It states which age group is suitable to consume the content of the respective app.
Genres: It gives the genre(s) to which the respective app belongs.
Last updated: It gives the day in which the latest update for the respective app was released.
Current Ver: It gives the current version of the respective app.
Android Ver: It gives the android version of the respective app.

➤ Steps Involved

Data Cleaning and Transforming :


To prepare the data for analysis, we performed several data cleaning steps. First, we checked for null values to ensure that there were no missing pieces of data. We also identified and removed outliers, especially in cases where ratings had a specific range. If null values existed and needed to be replaced with some value, we inserted values using the modeValue method. We modified data values, for size column we removed symbols like K and M and replaced them with their respective values, as well as removed unwanted characters like "+" and ",". We changed data types of columns to ensure that the data was in a format that was easy to analyze. Finally, we dropped duplicates and checked unique values to ensure the integrity of the data and that it was compliant with the intended datatype. A new column 'Revenue' was added by multiplying the prices and installs value for each record.

➤ Problem Statements-

1. Total number of apps present in the Google playstore dataset.
2. Number of Categories present in the dataset.
3. All categories with the number of apps in them.
4. Average rating and average size of all the apps.
5. Overview of all categories wrt Number of installs, least rated app, highest rated app, number of free apps and number of paid apps in that category in that category.
6. Which are the top 10 highest rated apps in the given available dataset?
7. What are the number of installs and reviews for the above apps? Return the apps with the highest reviews to the top.
8. Which app has the highest number of reviews? Also, mention the number of reviews and category of the app.
9. What is the total amount of revenue generated by the google play store by hosting apps? (Whenever a user buys apps from the google play store, the amount is considered in the revenue)
10. Which Category of google play store apps has the highest number of installs? Also, find out the total number of installs for that particular category.


➤ Challenges Faced 

• The Amount of Null values in the dataset were very high and had to be dropped while cleaning which took out almost 13.75% of the dataset, the integrity of the dataset was weak which lead to dropping 1491 rows just to remove Null values.
• The combined dataset after joining in SQL of both Playstore Apps and user reviews had only 500 apps in common, which accounts for merely 6.1 % of the total cleaned data. With a larger overlap of around 70% - 80% between the datasets, we could have derived more meaningful insights and conducted more valuable analysis.

 Many of the applications had their names containing only symbols and invalid characters, we found that those applications didn’t exist on the Google Playstore so we these applications had to be removed from the analysis.

➤ Conclusion

• There are total 33 categories and 8158 applications in the given dataset with an overall average rating of 4.2 and an average application size of 19.38 MB.
• For content rating, majority of the applications fall under ‘Everyone’ followed by ‘Teen’ and ‘Mature17+’. The least being ‘Adults only 18+’ and Unrated.
• Majority of the apps, 92.06% are listed as free while only 7.94% being of paid type. ‘Family’ followed by ‘Game’ have the highest number of paid apps.
• ‘Family’ is the top category with the highest number of applications followed by ‘Game’ while ‘Beauty’ and ‘Comics’ being the lowest.
• While ‘Family’ is the top category, it lags behind in revenue. ‘Lifestyle’ made the highest revenue followed by ‘Game’ and ‘Family’ while ‘Comics’ and ‘House and home’ made the least revenue.
