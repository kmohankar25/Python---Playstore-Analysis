Playstore Analysis - Python Project
INTRODUCTION

Application distribution platform, for example, Play Store gets overwhelmed with millions of new applications being launched on the platform regularly. Lots of designers and developers work on it to make an app successful on the Play Store. In this highly competitive world, it is an immense challenge for a developer to know whether they are focusing on the right path to make their app successful on the platform. To launch themselves successfully and create an identity for themselves in this oversaturated market, they need to ensure that majority of the essential factors are incorporated while designing and developing an app that would play an important role in customer's decision-making process. However, the lack of a clear understanding of the inner working and dynamic of popular app markets impacts both the developers and users.

OBJECTIVE

The main objective of this exploratory data analysis project is to understand customer demands better and thus help developers to popularize their product on the Play Store. One day on the evening of 8th August 2021, AlmaBetter plans to debut into the Android application by developing a mobile application on the play store platoform. They approaced us "Data Diggers" to help with building their technical know how about building a good android application. They wanted us to study current trends and insights of Play Store. We were given with two datasets i.e., Play Store & User Reviews. Before jumping into the data's provided, let me first explain you about the EDA analysis.
